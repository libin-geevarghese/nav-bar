navigation bar for websites

****************

In this code, we use the Bootstrap classes navbar, navbar-expand-md, navbar-dark, and bg-dark to create a dark navigation bar that expands to a full width navbar on medium and larger screens. The container class is used to center the content and add padding on both sides. The navbar-brand class is used to add a logo or brand name. The navbar-toggler class is used to create a button that toggles the collapsible menu. The data-bs-toggle, data-bs-target, aria-controls, aria-expanded, and aria-label attributes are used to control the toggling of the menu. The collapse and navbar-collapse classes are used to create a collapsible menu that is hidden by default and expands when the button is clicked. The navbar-nav class is used to create a list of links, and the nav-item and nav-link classes are used to style the individual links.

 With Bootstrap, you don't need to write any custom CSS or JavaScript code to create a responsive collapsible navigation bar. The Bootstrap classes handle everything for you. You can customize the styles and add more links as needed.
 
 (add fixed-top to make it fixed nav bar)

********
This code will create a navigation bar with two links ("Home" and "About") and a button that toggles a collapsible menu when clicked. The collapsible menu contains the same links as the navbar, but is hidden by default. The JavaScript code adds an event listener to the navbar toggler button that toggles the "show" class on the collapse-menu div when clicked. The "show" class has a display property of "flex", which will display the menu when added and hide it when removed. You can customize the CSS styles and add more links to the navbar and menu as needed.
